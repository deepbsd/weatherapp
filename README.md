# weatherapp
Skillcrush 104 final project

This is a simple CLI app that asks the user for a location (tested with zipcode...) and queries weather underground for 
today's weather as well as the forecast for the coming week.  The app prints out whether the day in question will be 
sunny or cloudy or stormy.  Then the app includes the temperature highs and lows for the respective days.

This app relies on the ruby gem Barometer.
